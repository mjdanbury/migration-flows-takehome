        Americans are continuing their yearslong flight from major urban
        centers, according to new 2024 population estimates from the U.S. Census
        Bureau.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike previous years, these urban departures have been largely offset
        by a surge in migration from other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet with the Trump administration’s aggressive policies to curtail
        immigration, it is uncertain whether these gains will be a long term fix
        for big cities whose post-covid populations are finding home elsewhere.

        Cities across the US — including New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami,
        Dallas, Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Washington
        D.C. — saw domestic migration away from their counties.
      </p>

      <p>Their losses were often neighboring counties’ gains.</p>

        Many of these losses come on the heels of losses of similar size as the
        COVID-19 pandemic and a shift to remote and hybrid work has reshaped
        people’s decision framework for where to call home.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the first time in recent years, these losses were largely offset by
        an influx of international migration.

        But this relief to cities in the form of a larger base of people to
        work, pay taxes, and spend money may be short lived. With the
        deportations, travel restrictions, and restrictions on student visas
        imposed by the Trump administration, it is unclear whether this offset
        will persist into 2025.
